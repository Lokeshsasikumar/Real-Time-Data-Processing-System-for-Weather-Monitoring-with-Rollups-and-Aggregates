## Features
- Real-time data retrieval from OpenWeatherMap API
- Continuous weather monitoring with user-configurable intervals
- Temperature conversion from Kelvin to Celsius or Fahrenheit
- Rollup calculations for daily summaries (average, min, max temperature)
- Alerting system based on thresholds (e.g., temperature exceeds 35Â°C)
- Visualizations for daily summaries and alerts

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- MySQL or SQLite for data storage
- Flask (for web visualization)
- OpenWeatherMap API key (sign up at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/))
